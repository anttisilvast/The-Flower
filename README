The Flower

The Flower is a small C program that syncs a 3D visual to Fourier analysis of MP3 music. It uses gcc, mpglib and OpenGL libraries and compiles in Linux. The demo is derived from a broader non-released VJ platform, which has been used e.g. at the Koneisto, piksel.no, Pixelache and ISEA festivals.

While not being a comprehensive VJ'ing or visualization framework, the routine aims to demonstrates the building blocks of music visualization: that is to say, real-time 3D graphics, Fourier analysis and the link between these two. The example is especially geared towards C programmers who would like to start to make their own OpenGL visuals with relatively small efforts. 

You can try the demo with the included song Track1.mp3. 

Installation and use:
********************

1. A binary called "act" is included, compiled for Intel Linux. 

2. To compile your own version, type make

3. To use, type:
   
     ./act <song_name.mp3>

   For fullscreen mode:

     ./act <song_name.mp3> -f 

For compiling you need to have the OpenGL libraries and SDL installed.
