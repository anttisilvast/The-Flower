The Flower

The Flower is a small C program that syncs a 3D visual to Fourier analysis of MP3 music. It uses gcc + mpglib + OpenGL 
and compiles in Linux. The demo is derived from a broader non-released VJ platform, which has been used e.g. at 
the Koneisto, piksel.no, Pixelache and ISEA festivals.

You can try this demo with the included song Track1.mp3. 

Installation and use:
********************

1. A binary called "act" is included, compiled for Intel Linux. 

2. To compile your own version, type make

3. To use, type:
   
     ./act <song_name.mp3>

   For fullscreen mode:

     ./act <song_name.mp3> -f 

For compiling you need to have the OpenGL libraries and SDL installed.
