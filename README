The Flower
**********

The Flower is a small C program that syncs a 3D visual to Fourier analysis of MP3 music. It uses gcc + mpglib + OpenGL 
for visuals and compiles in Linux. The demo is derived from a broader non-released VJ platform, which has been used 
e.g. at the Koneisto, piksel.no, Pixelache and ISEA festivals.

You can try this demo with the two included songs Track1.mp3 and Track2.mp3. 

Installation and use:
********************

1. A binary called "act" is included, compiled for Intel Linux. 

2. To compile your own version, type make

3. To use, type:
   
     ./act <song_name.mp3>

   For fullscreen mode:

     ./act <song_name.mp3> -f 

For compiling you need to have the OpenGL libraries and SDL installed.
